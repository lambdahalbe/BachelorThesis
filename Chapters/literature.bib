  abstract={In these notes I have given a personally flavored exposé of static density-functional theory (DFT). I have started from standard many-body physics at a very elementary level and then gradually introduced the basic concepts of DFT. Successively more advanced topics are added and at the end I even discuss a few not yet published theories. The discussion represents many of the personal views of the author and there is no attempt at being comprehensive. I fully realize that I am often 'unfair' in treating the achievements of other researchers. Many topics of standard DFT are deliberately left out like, e.g., time-dependence, excitations, and magnetic or relativistic effects. These notes represent a compilation of a series of lectures given at at the EXC!TING Summer School DFT beyond the ground state at Riksgränsen, Sweden in June of 2003.}

Abstract = {A grid-based real-space implementation of the projector augmented wave
   (PAW) method of Blochl {[}Phys. Rev. B 50, 17953 (1994)] for density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations is presented. The use of uniform
   three-dimensional (3D) real-space grids for representing wave
   functions, densities, and potentials allows for flexible boundary
   conditions, efficient multigrid algorithms for solving Poisson and
   Kohn-Sham equations, and efficient parallelization using simple
   real-space domain-decomposition. We use the PAW method to perform
   all-electron calculations in the frozen core approximation, with smooth
   valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse
   grids. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the
   atomization energies of 20 small molecules, and the bulk modulus and
   lattice constants of bulk aluminum. We show that the approach in terms
   of computational efficiency is comparable to standard plane-wave
   methods, but the memory requirements are higher.},

  abstract={Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package ( https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw] ) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.}

  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

Here we show that, provided $\sigma $ bond compression is taken into account, this result follows inevitably from even the simple l.c.a.o. theory, and is independent of the analytic form of either $\beta $(r), the resonance integral, or f(r), the $\sigma $ bond energy. An investigation of the linear polyenes C$_{2n}$H$_{2n+2}$ and C$_{2n+1}$H$_{2n+3}$ leads to the same conclusions, which contradict those of Lennard-Jones (1937) and Coulson (1938) but agree with those of Ooshika (1957) and Labhart (1957). A simple calculation, based on an exponential form for $\beta $(r), leads to a value of about 0$\cdot $04 angstrom for the difference in length between adjacent bonds in the infinite chain.},
